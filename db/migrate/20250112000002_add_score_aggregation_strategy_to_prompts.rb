# Migration to add score aggregation strategy to prompts.
#
# This allows each prompt to define how multiple evaluation scores
# should be combined into an overall score.
#
# Supported strategies:
# - simple_average: Average all evaluation scores equally
# - weighted_average: Use weights from evaluator_configs (default)
# - minimum: Take the lowest score (all must pass)
# - custom: Use custom business logic defined in the application
#
# Example:
#   prompt.update!(score_aggregation_strategy: "weighted_average")
#   # Now response.overall_score uses weighted average based on config weights
